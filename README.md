### 👋 Hey There!

I'm Slav, a dev who loves getting hands-on, whether that means wrestling with microcontrollers, wrangling servers, or painting pixels on a webpage. Think of me as a digital blacksmith, forging ideas into reality using a mix of code, CAD, and sometimes, actual 3D-printed parts.

For the past 6+ years, I've been navigating the awesome world where hardware meets software, leading product development and making cool stuff happen. My mission? To build things that are not just functional and efficient, but also look kinda cool without breaking the bank. Lately, I've been diving headfirst into the AI rabbit hole, exploring how we can train our own digital assistants and automate *all* the things.
